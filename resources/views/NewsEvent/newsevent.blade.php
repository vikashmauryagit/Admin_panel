                    <strong>Lion Tarachand Bapa Hospital & Research Centre</strong> is a thriving example of this age old maxim. From a small milk centre converted into a diagnostic centre by the Lions Club of Sion in 1970, to the present-day 65-bed facility, this hospital is the growing embodiment of a vision of affordable healthcare across the socioeconomic spectrum.

                <p>
                    This gargantuan project has been nurtured through the generosity of stalwarts of human upliftment and their faith reposed in us.

                    The C. U. Shah Diagnostic Centre, set up in 1970, inspired two philanthropists, Shri Tarachand Dhanjee Mehta and Shri C. M. Gandhi, more than a decade later, to make a donation large enough to scale up the facilities to a 12-bedded mini hospital with an operation theatre performing routine surgeries.

                    By 1989, another generous donation from his family converted this medical centre into a full-fledged hospital, christened Lion Tarachand Bapa Hospital & Research Centre, and adopted as a permanent project of the Lions Club of Sion.

                    In 1996, the Government of Maharashtra and Brihanmumbai Mahanagarpalika (BMC) offered some extra land to facilitate the extension of the building for the enhancement of the medical facilities.

                    The charity wing of the Lions Club International Foundation, the biggest overall donor, contributing over Rs. 2 crores in the form of five different grants for development in specific areas, and philanthropists like Lions Saryuben and Rajnikant Nanavati, who donated their entire estate to the hospital, have metamorphosed the hospital into a 65-bed facility with state-of-the-art equipment and eminent health professionals.
